						 <p>Twenty years ago I was about 27 years old. One day, I stood by a dying person and continuously shouting stupid words, like &quot;not to die&quot;, &quot;be brave&quot;. The poor woman passed away in my noise. At that time, I was an idiot about life and death. I thought that death is able to be defeated by courage, by mental power, and I have to remind it loudly when death is going to take life away.</p> <p>Whenever that story came up to my mind, a sense of guilt occupied me as more and more understandings on life and death. What a tragedy I made and how suffering she was!</p> <p>I believe that all you shared have great value to those who are seeking for knowledge of how to behave correctly in a situation like that. Because there is no second chance to do it again correctly.</p> <p>Thank you very much.</p>

						 <p>This barrier between the dying and the living was one thing I wanted to deconstruct and break&#8230; whether this will work more broadly, time will tell.</p> <p>And yes, I grew up in the UK (and have dual Belgian/UK citizenship), so that's the reason for the accent. :)</p>

						 <p>I don't use ZeroMQ but when I heard you on Ruby Rogues a while back I thought your point of view and wisdom was compelling. But for some reason in my memory you sounded British. Then I read you recent article about a protocol for dying and thought that too was compelling and sobering and wise. And there you mentioned ZeroMQ but placed yourself in Belgium. But it got me thinking, could this be the same guy? I went back to the Ruby Rogues bit and indeed it is the same guy.</p> <p>I recently had a close friend whose husband was dying. And I would call up and despite trying I could not overcome the reflect to begin the phone call with &quot;How are you guys doing&quot; which always was met with a half-joke half-ironic &quot;great!&quot;. When I visited him he was not speaking at all and from what she said the cancer had affected his cognition but I was pretty clear that he was aware. Again, stuck for the right words.</p> <p>So thank you for your writing and your sharing and your contributions. You are indeed in my thoughts.</p> <p>Pito</p>
