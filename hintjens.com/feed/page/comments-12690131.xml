						 <p>Peter this post is amazing - it captures some powerful yet subtle things we can all do yet have not got labels for in some wickedly funny words - excellent excellent : )</p> <p>My 2 cents on 'Let me know how social engineering works for you'.</p> <p>I never 'officially' learnt computers so have had an inferiority complex when talking to the smart people who went to proper skool.</p> <p>I've always overcome this by playing the diligent fool - humble yet hard working and attentive, throw in a healthy dose of humour and comradery and it's amazing how potentially hostile conversations (like I need to take your code-base away from you) have turned into friendship creating ones.</p> <p>It seems that if your objective is to create a healthy and productive working relationship with somebody you are going to learn from - humbleness is the key.</p> <p>Thanks again for a great post, a wonderful rant about Scotland (from a 1/2 Welsh person) and well, ummm, ZeroMQ : )</p>
