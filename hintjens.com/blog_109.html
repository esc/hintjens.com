<p>On December 10th 2010, I didn't start to die. Instead, a surgeon opened me up, and removed the cancer that was spreading rapidly through my bile duct, to my lymph nodes and pancreas. I survived the surgery, a resistant infection, and chemotherapy. So far, so good. Today I celebrate five years of extended life with a personal article.</p>
<h2 id="toc0"><span>About Me, Really</span></h2>
<p>I don't often write about myself, except when people demand it. I'd much rather people looked at my work than my biography. Still, some stories are worth telling. One of them is the cold horror of your own body trying to kill you. Cancer is scary. A close friend asked me not to kiss on the cheek, as we do in Belgium. &quot;I don't want to risk getting it,&quot; she said. &quot;You know I've got a young baby.&quot; We still speak, though less often than before.</p>
<p>How does one survive cancer? It's simple and unfair: one does not die, yet. We all die eventually, which is a good thing. Death is the Great Garbage Collector. Yet we go through extraordinary effort to not die, yet. For me, that meant letting my Congolese surgeon Dr. Mbote and his team slice me open, remove half my pancreas, lymph nodes, duodenum, bile duct and gall bladder, and lower stomach valve, and then reconnect the pieces in a Rube Goldberg operation lasting twelve hours. Google &quot;Whipple procedure&quot; if you want details.</p>
<p>I woke up wrapped in the evil ancestor of all pain. I can't describe it. Near my hand was a small trigger to push, to get a small dose of pain killer. Normally, ten or twenty times in a day. I pushed it over a thousand times the first few hours (they told me, later). I'd have screamed every time I moved, except the tubes in my nose and throat made that impossible.</p>
<p>The pain and thirst (the first two weeks I could not drink a drop of water) were bad. Worse was the waking hallucination when they tried a stronger pain killer, morphine I think. There was heavy rock music, and this animated vision of Hell in a striking flame and blood palette. Nothing I have ever seen in the darkest corners of the Internet will ever compare. When you are trapped and confronted by horror, you tell yourself, &quot;it will pass.&quot; And so I counted the seconds, one by one. And it passed, as it always does.</p>
<p>I like to think a little bit of Hell came back with me. I got stronger, came back home, looked after myself as body and digestive system rebooted. Then I went straight back to work, popping in to the chemotherapy clinic in Brussels once a week for my dose of poison. One gets used to needles. I found a client in Dallas and started a year and a half of non-stop travel.</p>
<p>Some clients are nice to work with. This one was not. I protected my team, carefully built up our product, and bullied management into behaving. It ended with us shipping out to South Korea, opening an office right outside the client's campus, and wildcatting our way through the vicious politics. We did a good job, and in the end they paid all our invoices.</p>
<p>At which point I decided to stay at home and look after my young kids. They were glad to have their dad back. And I became mom too, a single parent. And every day, in the back of my mind, &quot;this could be my last month, or year.&quot;</p>
<p>Is my cancer gone? I cannot know. I can only know if it comes back, in my blood, in my bones. I do the scans, every six months, every year. &quot;Nothing,&quot; they tell me. &quot;Nothing, yet,&quot; they think. I still carry the port where they'd stab me once a week. &quot;It's not really worth removing,&quot; says my oncologist. &quot;maybe next year.&quot; That pain in my shoulder, not going away. Is the cancer back? No, it's damage from too much drumming.</p>
<p>What would you do with your life, if every month or year could be your last?</p>
<p>For me, it was raising my kids, writing, going to conferences, and finding clients who would let me work from home. None of these are easy. Yet they are just a matter of focus, and determination.</p>
<p>Writing books is like writing articles, just more. Life hits us with questions. We try to answer them. My way of thinking about complex questions is to write. I think I'm good at this, and reading my work from years ago, I find myself thinking, &quot;nice, this person got it.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps it's the self-flattery of the wanna-be expert. I hope not. Some of us think as part of the crowd. We adopt the thoughts of others, and we rarely step outside predefined boundaries. We are bricks in walls and we feel good there.</p>
<p>I've been outside the walls, a foreigner, all my life. We live in Molenbeek, the terrorist capital of Europe, because in a city of immigrants, this commune of the undocumented feels most like home to me. All my professional life I've worked to overthrow existing systems. Is writing code an act of revolution? For me, yes. Deliberately so. I want to smash the Wall, and its self-righteous mistreatment of the less powerful. I dream of collisions.</p>
<p>A project like ZeroMQ goes beyond &quot;disruptive.&quot; It is about taking the old rule book, burning it, and peeing on the smoking remains. Not just rules about commercial software. We also rewrote the rules on how to make open source. Activist communities can be as abusive and arrogant as any company. Worse, in many cases.</p>
<p>Writing, also, is a revolutionary act. I'm mostly a polite writer, because I think manners are important. We don't need to insult or diminish others to disagree with them. And politeness lets us learn from those we disagree with. Yet when I write I am remorseless. Why pull a punch? Better to be wrong than to be silent.</p>
<p>I'm a traitor to my &quot;race&quot; and gender and culture. These are boxes to contain and divide us. The lure of privilege was always there, growing up in a diplomatic family. We had servants and mango trees. Yet my first language was Swahili. I was always outside the walls, making friends with those who had the least and who shone with decency.</p>
<p>The debt of privilege is massive, yet it is like any debt. You repay little by little, as you can. You never forget it, and you never justify it. For me, paying off that debt meant returning to Africa many times, to work there, to make life-long friends in Togo, Lagos, Ouagadougou. I consider myself the lucky refugee, blessed with opportunity, and able to invest that back in others.</p>
<p>It meant working in the public good. My first free software project dates from 1991. I spent years working unpaid to fight against software patents, and for open standards. Collisions: we challenged billion dollar institutions and forced them back. This was no guilt trip: the slow, deliberate repayment of the debt of privilege was always a pleasure. And one learns, one learns.</p>
<p>I refuse to take sides. Predators come in all genders and colors, shapes and sizes. The bulk of decent people also come in all genders and colors. For every twenty-five Alices and Bobs, one Mallory. The abusers love to divide to conquer. An ethical system gives all participants equal opportunities and rights. And it brings people <em>together</em> instead of creating divisions.</p>
<p>So call me an atheist humanist if you want a label. I hold that every person contributes something, even the &quot;worst&quot; among us. Even through war and destruction, we learn how to move forwards as a species. We live, or we die, as one species. There are no race, gender, or culture wars. These are illusions that deceive and divide.</p>
<p>Our forever war, as a species, is against ignorance and magical thinking. Only accurate knowledge can secure our future. There is no price tag for this. If it takes blood and pain to learn, then we pay in blood and pain. The little piece of Hell on my shoulder tells me (metaphorically, I'm not delusional): &quot;no-one cares, you mean nothing, you're just a meat machine. So work, now!&quot;</p>
<p>Which is why I write. Capture problems, try solutions, write it down in plain language, and invite criticism. Trial and error, and no matter how much people are offended, keep going.</p>
<p>The books: three so far. Each takes years of research, and six to nine months of writing during which unpaid bills pile up. Through every book I've learned a lot and aim to capture these lessons for others. The Psychopath Code was the hardest book to write, technically. I'm not a psychologist by training. Yet the book is solid and accurate. It is a book I needed, and found nowhere, so had to make.</p>
<p>When you express yourself, you invite attack. It is an essential part of the process, to stand up and be ridiculed. Here's a dismissal of my book (from Twitter, now deleted): &quot;I know more about psychology than this guy, and my dissertation was in psychopaths! I should critique his book&#8230; but&#8230; no.&quot;</p>
<p>Young person, if you know so much about psychopaths, why aren't you out doing the same research I did? Are you talking to victims and psychopaths about their experiences? Where's your research on predator-prey models and the relevance for humans? How about the profit-loss accounting of abuse? Why aren't you describing how the abusive bond works? And critically, how to break it and get out with our minds intact. We need to know this stuff.</p>
<p>Enough people studying this material, for decades. So many experts. And really, so many excellent studies and papers. So why did I need to write that book? Institutions, that's why. The more you know, the less you see. Live outside the walls, and you get a different and broader perspective.</p>
<p>I have a profound lack of respect for institutions, their walls and bricks; their protection of ignorance, their fear of originality and real diversity of thought. Their narrowing of focus, and their dishonest reverence for authority.</p>
<p>There are good institutions, such as the medical system that saved my life. Yet even sick and dying I was able to diagnose myself faster and more accurately with my mobile phone than the doctors could. &quot;It's not a gall stone, so can we do a biopsy already, please?&quot; &quot;Yes, I'm getting allergic to the pain killer, that is why I'm vomiting and ripping out my stitches. Please stop giving it to me.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't simply careful decision-making. It was slowness, and it almost killed me. When you have a fast-growing cancer, an extra week to make a biopsy can be fatal.</p>
<p>The more we invest in structure and organization, the stupider we become. The smartest teams are small and dynamic and focused on solving problems through trial-and-error, not debate. Let alone the common pattern of &quot;you are an idiot, and you are wrong, and I will tell you why.&quot; Or, god help us, politics and the thirst for power.</p>
<p>I want to say &quot;thank you&quot; to the hundreds, thousands of people I've met and spoken with over the last years. You've been wonderful, and given me so much. Most of my pre-cancer friends drifted away, after I didn't die. I recall one seeing me at a conference, going pale. &quot;You're not dead!&quot; Indeed, no, I may be bald, but I'm not dead. Yet.</p>
<p>Five years seems worth celebrating. I did a lot these last five years: paid off many of my debts; became a full-time parent to my kids, who became happy bundles of love and laughter; rebuilt a business; wrote some heavy, solid books and over a hundred articles; taught myself piano and started composing; and saw most of my projects thrive and survive.</p>
<p>Don't wait for life to come knocking. Go out there, with love and optimism, and make good things happen.</p>
<p>The constant silent threat of recurrence defines my view of my work, and my life. Every one of my articles, books, projects, tweets, and patches is the last. Every time I leave someone I care about, I tell them how much they mean to me, hug them if possible.</p>
<p>No exceptions, no false drama. Every meal I eat is the last one I'll ever taste. Every song I play is the last one, before cancer drags me back to an iron bed and those damned beeping pumps. My music isn't sad, it's just always saying &quot;adieu&quot;. These are the rituals of the survivor, yet they are a powerful tool. Try it, one time, to make every song your last.</p>
<p>And the weirdest part was the joy at being alive. From that moment five years ago, except when I was shuddering from the pain, I was euphoric. The sheer ridiculousness of not dying, yet, wore off after a year or two. The pleasure at being alive and surrounded by lovely people (twenty-five to one, I remind myself) sometimes spills over.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think my cancer saved my kids and me from a terrible alternate time line. Then again, I hope one doesn't need to go through cancer to become a happier person. If you can be truly thankful for the last five seconds of your life, you don't have to be thankful for the rest.</p>
<p>Here now is the payload of this self-indulgent article. Five simple wishes to make the Internet a happier, better place. (<em>Now</em> you can call me delusional.)</p>
<h2 id="toc1"><span>More Manners</span></h2>
<p>We seriously lack manners, on-line. It's as if being rude to total strangers suddenly became acceptable somewhere around 1998. It isn't cool. If you're one of those people who like to use clever adjectives to denigrate people you disagree with, realize this: it makes you look bad.</p>
<h2 id="toc2"><span>Less Arrogance</span></h2>
<p>&quot;I've studied X so your opinion on it is obviously wrong,&quot; is a logical fallacy. Claiming expertise because you lack originality is easy, and weak. Go out there and make mistakes! Learn by going beyond what you get second-hand. Solve real problems with new crazy theories, and don't be afraid to share them.</p>
<h2 id="toc3"><span>Calm It Down</span></h2>
<p>&quot;I don't agree with what you say, so you're toxic,&quot; is a common yet useless pattern. It infects open source (&quot;you made a bad patch so you're toxic&quot;) and open discussion. Most people are honest, self-correcting, sincere. Some bad actors, toxic, and damaging. Learn to tell the difference by measuring your pain.</p>
<h2 id="toc4"><span>Take Time to Think</span></h2>
<p>Instead of reacting, act. Take time to read what people say, and try to understand why they say it. Everyone's perspective is a fact. Don't argue with facts. Argue against interpretations, or better, try to help others to fix their arguments.</p>
<h2 id="toc5"><span>Trust Yourself</span></h2>
<p>You don't need to be perfect. Every day, take a risk, learn something new, and speak to someone who you'd otherwise ignore. If people are hostile to you, shrug and carry on. There are a <em>lot</em> of people on this planet. No matter who you are, or what you do, you are precious, and there are people who will appreciate that.</p>

<p>hi Pieter,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing.</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Testicular Cancer in December 2009. Strange how a long uncertain recovery forces you to re-evaluate your live choices&#8230;</p>
<p>I greatly admire all your accomplishments. My focus was mostly personal afterwards. With the kids getting older now, I hope to be part of changing the world for the better :).</p>

<p>1) &quot;We all die eventually, which is a good thing. Death is the Great Garbage Collector. Yet we go through extraordinary effort to not die, yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Congratulations for surviving a fast-growing cancer.<br />
Perhaps, it's harsh to a survivor to say that I do not like to consider myself as a garbage to be collected. I and you are not garbages. There should be other ways than dying of cancer to make humans behave( or collect garbages to speak metaphorically). We deserve to treat ourselves better after everything you and I have done and will do to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>2) The only long-term cure for cancer is life extension therapies.</p>
<p>According to Aubrey de Grey(Watch www.youtube.com watch?v=pPqGrKg_HqA for introduction to his research), aging process increases the probability of getting cancer and various diseases related to old age. It means if you live long enough, you're going to be afflicted with any one of cancer, heart disease, and various other diseases. Curing the symptomps of diseases only delays the inevitable for a while. The only long-term cure to diseases of old age is to keep your body healthy with life extension therapies. So, life extension research is actually about maintaining optimal health no matter how old you are. David Sinclair could release the first life extension drug or therapy within a decade. Just, hang on for some decades. Technological growth is or can be exponential. You may be able to hope for seeing your grand grand children. I like to give people hope.</p>
<p>3) &quot;There are good institutions, such as the medical system that saved my life.&quot;</p>
<p>The medical institution is significantly better than the mainstream business. However, in my opinion, it is not good enough, and we can design a much better institution than that.</p>
<p>By the way, how did your smartphone diagnose you faster and more accurately than doctors? I want to know.</p>
<p>4) &quot;The more we invest in structure and organization, the stupider we become.&quot;</p>
<p>Not necessarily. You invested a lot of time into community building, and you arrived at a good institution such as zeromq community. Zeromq community is a community institution in the same way as LaTeX user groups(www.tug.org) are. Just because institutions of the past are cruel and stupid, it doesn't mean newly designed institutions are and will be bad. People learn from mistakes of the past and design better things.</p>
<p>We just have to design better institutions that outcompete the mainstream business financially and provide technologists with opportunities to manage their own affairs where they are not dominated by typical corporate managers.</p>
<p>5) I'm designing a cooperative institution for long-term technological challenges.</p>
<p>The banks do not fund businesses whose success rates are under 90%, and they shouldn't take more risk than they do now. The mainstream business is focused on short-term gains, so it doesn't fund long-term technical challenges. Venture capitals in silicon valley mostly fund companies that go viral within 3-4 years or die. Other places do not have as much money as silicon valley, yet.</p>
<p>Giant companies like facebook, google, and microsoft hire a few researchers, but that's not good enough. Meanwhile, millions of talented people on this planet are not given financial opportunities to contribute by technical research like rich hickey's work on clojure.</p>
<p>The initial idea for a new institution came from the history of polycentric legal system, co-operatives, and michaelochurch.wordpress.com slash 2015 slash 10 slash 01 slash silicon-valley-can-be-beaten</p>
<p>I started designing a new institution a few days ago. I'll soon read psychopath code and some other books for more information.</p>
<p>I will contact you for advice on how to minimize or even eradicate vulnerabilities to trolls and psychopaths in the kind of institution I'm designing. I can't do this alone.</p>

<p>If you design organizations, understand how the ZeroMQ community works. It's not an institution. It's a market of projects, each independent and many competing, who share knowledge and trade expertise. The market regulates itself with contracts that are carefully designed to make it unprofitable for bad actors to interfere.</p>
<p>No structure, no organization. I'm dead serious: there is no ZeroMQ Foundation, no staff, no offices. This isn't laziness, it's by design.</p>
<p>I've built structure and organization often and know how much it consumes.</p>
<p>The smartphone: well, it let me check my own symptoms rapidly and exclude the possible candidates. I was turning yellow. The choices were: gall stones, or tumor in my bile duct. The ultrasound showed no stones, one hour after I was admitted. It took them one week more to do a biopsy.</p>
<p>As for not getting cancer&#8230; the probable cause in my case was a parasite called a liver fluke, which attaches to the bile duct and produces carcinogens. Nature is nice like that. The parasite comes from farmed fresh-water fish. The cancer I had is a major cause of death in SE Asia. I think it was cheap sushi that almost killed me.</p>
<p>And lastly, to garbage collection. It's not pejorative. Life is append only. We make space for others, that is how it works and has to work.</p>

<p>The meaning of institution is broader than you currently think.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution</a>, Institutions are &quot;stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior.&quot; As structures or mechanisms of social order, they govern the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community. Institutions are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior. The term &quot;institution&quot; commonly applies to a custom or behavior pattern important to a society, and to particular formal organizations of the government and public services. As structures and mechanisms of social order, institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology</p>
<p>In case of ZeroMQ community, it is governed by C4.1 and a benevolent dictator who enforces it. C4.1 is an attempt to repeat a desired pattern of behaviors. An institution doesn't need to have designated officers, offices, and/or managers.</p>
