						 <p>Damn it man, I really enjoyed our last evening out after a conference in London. Are you still able to drink beer? I certainly hope so, I'm guessing life's too short to waist it on hangovers now though, wisdom at last.</p> <p>Just wanted to pass on my regards and I shall have a few on your behalf, you can count on that!</p> <p>-John Davies-</p>

						 <p>I only discovered 0MQ last weekend when I was searching an alternative for my distribution problem. I was really impressed with the performance &amp; I discovered your blog.</p> <p>I've read &amp; reread most of it &amp; a lot more. I really like your vision on open source software &amp; its power. The same applies to merging master &amp; when you talked about your daughter merging patches brought a big grin on my face. Brilliant in simplicity.</p> <p>I'm not a software developer, but an information scientist (who uses Python a lot) who is worried about the hijacking of the Internet by commerce.</p> <p>The Internet is the most important new medium since bookprinting and enables everybody everywhere access to acquire and distribute information fast at virtually no cost. Too good to be used as an enormous webshop where everything has to be monetized. Economy is important but only as a tool and not a goal.</p> <p>So 0MQ, GPL3, C4.1 and CC will become important components in the project I'm building and enable me to start publishing a lot sooner &amp; as an extra hopefully build a community as well.</p> <p>You became an inspiration real fast. Thank you van een kaaskop.</p>

						 <p>Dear Pieter, I was watching 'De Afspraak' last night and much to my surprise, I saw someone I knew. And then, I heard why you were there. I'm sure you don't remember me, but I know you from your time you sometimes helped us out at Delight (Ostend). You still are the same intelligent, realistic, no-nonsens person. Not looking for sympathy nor compliments. I just want to pay my respects to such a great person. I hope you have a wonderful party in June and hope you can still enjoy the little time that you have left. And now for something completely different&#8230;. i tHOROUGHLY HATE THE CAPSLOCK BUTTON AS WELL.</p>
