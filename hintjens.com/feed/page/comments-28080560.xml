						 <p>Cheap is important, but remember that buying really cheap computer hardware means you'll be paying more over time than if you get something built to last.</p> <p>In particular a refurbished Mac of any sort is a great idea, you can still use UNIX tools with it and the build quality means you can use it for a long, long time if needed.</p> <p>I'm also not sure why the item about learning small languages instead of C++ is stuck in &quot;costs low&quot;. I think it's good to try a variety of languages and see what ends up appealing to you&#8230; although I would agree that C++ is really a better second language attempt if you want to try it, rather than a first&#8230; but you should also research what is popular in terms of languages around what you want to do. If you want to make games, C++ is probably a good choice.</p>
