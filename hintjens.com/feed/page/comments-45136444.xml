						 <p>Some conferences, as you note, will be more amenable to this than others. But it's hard to argue that kids will be less mature than a lot of programmers at coding conferences. And if it's a duller conference, having activities oriented towards kids, but related to the conference purpose somehow is culture building.</p> <p>Boise Code Camp had added an entire Youth Track that occurs as part of the conference, and it has been a huge success.</p>

						 <p>I only recently began my CS journey, so I haven't even attended a conference myself yet, but this sounds like a great idea! I have three kids also, and they are also well-behaved. Maybe time spent away doesn't need to be time spent apart, which is a great sell.</p>
