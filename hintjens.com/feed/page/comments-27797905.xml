						 <p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Wikipedia's explanation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Regardless the magnitude of the improvement, the theoretical speedup is always limited by the part of the task that cannot benefit from the improvement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the logic, as far as I can tell:</p> <p>If a project takes 20 days for one person, and there is part of the work that takes one day, and which cannot be sped up, then your effective maximum team size is 20. (1,000 people will still complete the project in min. one day).</p> <p>So if your teams spends 5% of its time in meetings, its effective maximum size (assuming there are <em>all</em> other tasks can be done in parallel) is 20. If it spends 20% of its time in meetings, its effective max. size is 5.</p> <p>Remember that your &quot;effective team size&quot; is always relative to a single person working smoothly. It's not because everyone seems to be working that they are in fact doing so.</p> <p>So in practice this figure is fuzzy. Individuals are not perfectly efficient, and teams get pulled into many forms of inefficiency beyond meetings. Planning meetings are a symptom rather than direct cause of slow, blocking processes.</p>

						 <p>How did you calculate the effective team size from the number of hours that team members spend together in meetings?</p>
